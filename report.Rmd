# Introduction

This report embarks on a journey through the intricacies of developer compensation, comparing and contrasting findings from the StackOverflow surveys of 2022 and 2023. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive analysis that sheds light on the nuances of salary trends across various dimensions, offering valuable insights for both employers and developers alike.

# Median salary distribution on level of experience

In this section we will compare the distribution of salaries in 2018 and 2023 and ask an important question: do programmers earn more in 2023 than in 2018?

## Comparison of the distribution in 2018 and 2023

First, we investigate how salary changed over the six years.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE,  message=FALSE, cache=FALSE, fig.width=10,fig.fullwidth=TRUE}
experience_levels <- c(
    "0-2", "3-5", "6-8", "9-11",
    "12-14", "15-17", "18-20", "21-23",
    "24-26", "27-29", "30 or more"
)

discretize_experience <- function(experience) {
    experience <- as.numeric(experience)
    return(case_when(
        experience >= 0 & experience <= 2 ~ "0-2",
        experience >= 3 & experience <= 5 ~ "3-5",
        experience >= 6 & experience <= 8 ~ "6-8",
        experience >= 9 & experience <= 11 ~ "9-11",
        experience >= 12 & experience <= 14 ~ "12-14",
        experience >= 15 & experience <= 17 ~ "15-17",
        experience >= 18 & experience <= 20 ~ "18-20",
        experience >= 21 & experience <= 23 ~ "21-23",
        experience >= 24 & experience <= 26 ~ "24-26",
        experience >= 27 & experience <= 29 ~ "27-29",
        TRUE ~ "30 or more"
    ))
}

exp_sal18 <- res2018 %>%
    select(Experience, Salary) %>%
    na.omit() %>%
    mutate(Experience = gsub(" years", "", Experience)) %>%
    mutate(Experience = factor(Experience, levels = experience_levels, ordered = TRUE)) %>%
    group_by(Experience) %>%
    summarize(MedSalary = median(Salary)) %>%
    mutate(year = "2018")

exp_sal23 <- res2023 %>%
    select(Experience, Salary) %>%
    na.omit() %>%
    mutate(Experience = discretize_experience(Experience)) %>%
    mutate(Experience = factor(Experience, levels = experience_levels, ordered = TRUE)) %>%
    group_by(Experience) %>%
    summarize(MedSalary = median(Salary)) %>%
    mutate(year = "2023")

exp_sal <- union(exp_sal18, exp_sal23)

g <- ggplot(exp_sal, aes(x = Experience, y = MedSalary, fill = year)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge(), width = 0.45) +
    labs(
        fill = "Year",
        title = "Salary Accross Professional Experience",
        x = "Years of professional coding",
        y = "Median Salary"
    ) +
    ggtitle(
        "Median salary accross experience level"
    )
ggplotly(g)
```

Apart from the obvious fact that salary increases with the experience, we observe and an interesting decline in more experienced professionalists in 2023 with respect to 2018. This unusual situation need further analysis to explain this phenomen.

## Inflation between 2018 and 2023

Comparing salaries in 5 years period we cannot forget about inflation. As salaries have been converted to USD by the StackOverflow at the time, we can take only dollar's inflation into the account

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=10,fig.fullwidth=TRUE}
usd_inflation <- data.frame(
    Year = c(2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023),
    Inflation = c(2.44, 1.81, 1.23, 4.70, 8.00, 4.10) / 100
)

ggplot(usd_inflation, aes(x = Year, y = Inflation)) +
    geom_smooth() +
    geom_point() +
    scale_y_continuous(
        labels = scales::percent,
        breaks = seq(0, 0.08, 0.005)
    ) +
    ggtitle("Inflation Between 2018 And 2023", )

total_inflation <- prod(1 + usd_inflation$Inflation) - 1
```

It's important to remark that we the conversion rates between currencies do not depend *only* Inflation.

## Do programmers earn more in 2023 than in 2018?

After consideration we may wonder how the changes relate to the inflation.

The total cumulative inflation between 2018 and 2023 was: **`r round(total_inflation * 100,1)`%**

We now examine how percentage-wise changes in compensation, compare to the inflation.

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=10,fig.fullwidth=TRUE}
salary_increase <- (exp_sal23$MedSalary - exp_sal18$MedSalary) / exp_sal18$MedSalary

salary_increase_df <- data.frame(
    Experience = exp_sal23$Experience,
    SalaryIncrease = salary_increase
)
salary_increase_df <- salary_increase_df %>%
    mutate(earnsMore = case_when(
        SalaryIncrease > total_inflation ~ "Yes",
        total_inflation >= SalaryIncrease & SalaryIncrease >= 0 ~ "Intermediate",
        TRUE ~ "Less"
    ))


g <- ggplot(salary_increase_df, aes(x = Experience, y = SalaryIncrease, fill = earnsMore)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
    geom_hline(yintercept = total_inflation, color = "black", linetype = "dashed") +
    annotate("text", x = 8, y = total_inflation + 0.03, label = "Cumulative inflation between 2018 and 2023", color = "black", size = 4) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent, limit = c(-0.5, 0.5), breaks = sort(c(seq(-0.5, 0.5, 0.1), total_inflation))) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("Yes" = "#8de800", "Intermediate" = "orange", "Less" = "red")) +
    labs(
        title = "Changes In Salary Vetween 2018 And 2023",
        subtitle = "In comparison to the inflation rate",
        x = "Experience level",
        y = "Change in salary"
    ) +
    guides(fill = FALSE)
ggplotly(g)
```

As we can see, even though the nominal salary increased in for developers up to 23 years of experience, the only group that earns more after these 5 years are new developers.

# Admired languages and salary

Now we will examine, if languages that are especially liked by programmers, bring them more income.

```{r, fig.width=10, fig.fullwidth=TRUE, fig.height=10, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE}
admired18 <- res2018 %>%
    select(AdmiredLanguage, Salary) %>%
    separate_rows(AdmiredLanguage, sep = ";") %>%
    group_by(AdmiredLanguage) %>%
    summarize(SalaryMed = median(Salary), AdmiredLanguageCount = n())

g <- ggplot(admired18, aes(x = AdmiredLanguageCount, y = SalaryMed, color = AdmiredLanguage, fill = AdmiredLanguage)) +
    geom_jitter(show.legend = FALSE) +
    geom_text(
        aes(label = AdmiredLanguage),
        vjust = case_when(
            admired18$AdmiredLanguage == "Python" ~ 1.5,
            admired18$AdmiredLanguage == "CSS" ~ 1.8,
            admired18$AdmiredLanguage == "Visual Basic 6" ~ 1,
            admired18$AdmiredLanguage == "C++" ~ 1,
            admired18$AdmiredLanguage == "Perl" ~ 1,
            TRUE ~ -0.5
        ),
        hjust = ifelse(admired18$AdmiredLanguage == "JavaScript", 1, -0.2),
        show.legend = FALSE
    ) +
    theme(legend.position = "none") +
    labs(
        title = "Sentiment to Salary of Languages Comparison",
        x = "Number of programmers, which want to work with the language",
        y = "Median Salary"
    )
g
```

As we can see we obtain a triangular shape. Languages, which developers want to use the most, are in the middle of salaries. In this graph we can see also market laws, because for less desired languages, market pays more. However,  choosing 

# Is it better to work in big companies?

We wanted to examine if at different stages of professional life is it more worth it to work in small companies or big corporations?

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=9, fig.fullwidth=TRUE}
company_levels <- c(
    "Freelancer",
    "2 to 9 employees",

    "1,000 to 4,999 employees",
    "5,000 to 9,999 employees",
    "10,000 or more employees"
)

company_salary18 <- res2018 %>%
    select(
        CompanySize, Salary, Experience
    ) %>%
    na.omit() %>%
    mutate(Experience = gsub(" years", "", Experience)) %>%
    mutate(Experience = factor(Experience, levels = experience_levels, ordered = TRUE)) %>%
    mutate(CompanySize = factor(CompanySize, levels = company_levels, ordered = TRUE)) %>%
    group_by(CompanySize, Experience) %>%

    ) +

        subtitle = "Divided By Experience Level",
        y = "Salary Median",
    ) +
    scale_fill_brewer(
        palette = "Paired"
    )

g23 <- ggplot(company_salary23, aes(x = CompanySize, y = SalaryMed, fill = CompanySize), format(y, scientific = FALSE)) +

Interestingly, it seems that working in big giants is always most profitable. On the other hand, the more experience you have the more plot bulge around 500-999 employees.

# 

# Best paying countries

Of course salary depends greatly on the country you work with.

```{r world_map, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE,fig.width=10, fig.fullwidth=TRUE}
