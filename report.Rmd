# Introduction

In this report we will analyze the StackOverflow 2018 and 2023 Survey data. We put our focus on comparisons of different aspects of programmer's life with respect to salary. In particular, we will explore 

```{r setup, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
library("plotly")
library("dplyr")
library("tidyr")
library("stringr")
library("ggplot2")

res2018raw <- read.csv("./developer_surveys/survey_results_2018.csv", sep = ",", header = TRUE)
res2018 <- res2018raw %>%
    select(DevType, Salary = ConvertedSalary, Experience = YearsCodingProf, AdmiredLanguage = LanguageDesireNextYear, CompanySize) %>%
    mutate(Salary = as.numeric(Salary)) %>%
    filter(!is.na(Salary) & Salary != 0)

res2023raw <- read.csv("./developer_surveys/survey_results_2023.csv", sep = ",", header = TRUE)
res2023 <- res2023raw %>%
    select(DevType, Salary = ConvertedCompYearly, Experience = YearsCodePro, CompanySize = OrgSize, Country)
```

# Median salary distribution on level of experience

In this section we will compare the distribution of salaries in 2018 and 2023 and ask an important question: do programmers earn more in 2023 than in 2018?

## Comparison of the distribution in 2018 and 2023

First, we investigate how salary changed over the six years:
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=FALSE, fig.width=10,fig.fullwidth=TRUE}
experience_levels <- c(
    "0-2", "3-5", "6-8", "9-11",
    "12-14", "15-17", "18-20", "21-23",
    "24-26", "27-29", "30 or more"
)

discretize_experience <- function(experience) {
    experience <- as.numeric(experience)
    return(case_when(
        experience >= 0 & experience <= 2 ~ "0-2",
        experience >= 3 & experience <= 5 ~ "3-5",
        experience >= 6 & experience <= 8 ~ "6-8",
        experience >= 9 & experience <= 11 ~ "9-11",
        experience >= 12 & experience <= 14 ~ "12-14",
        experience >= 15 & experience <= 17 ~ "15-17",
        experience >= 18 & experience <= 20 ~ "18-20",
        experience >= 21 & experience <= 23 ~ "21-23",
        experience >= 24 & experience <= 26 ~ "24-26",
        experience >= 27 & experience <= 29 ~ "27-29",
        TRUE ~ "30 or more"
    ))
}

exp_sal18 <- res2018 %>%
    select(Experience, Salary) %>%
    na.omit() %>%
    mutate(Experience = gsub(" years", "", Experience)) %>%
    mutate(Experience = factor(Experience, levels = experience_levels, ordered = TRUE)) %>%
    group_by(Experience) %>%
    summarize(MedSalary = median(Salary)) %>%
    mutate(year = "2018")

exp_sal23 <- res2023 %>%
    select(Experience, Salary) %>%
    na.omit() %>%
    mutate(Experience = discretize_experience(Experience)) %>%
    mutate(Experience = factor(Experience, levels = experience_levels, ordered = TRUE)) %>%
    group_by(Experience) %>%
    summarize(MedSalary = median(Salary)) %>%
    mutate(year = "2023")

exp_sal <- union(exp_sal18, exp_sal23)

g <- ggplot(exp_sal, aes(x = Experience, y = MedSalary, fill = year)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge(), width = 0.45) +
    labs(
        fill = "Year",
        title = "Salary Accross Professional Experience",
        x = "Years of professional coding",
        y = "Median Salary"
    ) +
    ggtitle(
        "Median salary accross experience level"
    )
ggplotly(g)
```
Apart from the obvious fact that salary increases with the experience, we observe and interesting decline in more experienced professionalist. 

## Inflation between 2018 and 2023
Comparing salaries in 5 years period we cannot forget about inflation. As salaries have been converted to USD by the StackOverflow at the time, we can take only dollar's inflation into the account


```{r, echo=FALSE}
usd_inflation <- data.frame(
    Year = c(2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023),
    Inflation = c(2.44, 1.81, 1.23, 4.70, 8.00, 4.10) / 100
)

ggplot(usd_inflation, aes(x = Year, y = Inflation)) +
    geom_smooth() +
    geom_point() +
    scale_y_continuous(
        labels = scales::percent,
        breaks = seq(0, 0.08, 0.005)
    ) +
    ggtitle("Inflation Between 2018 And 2023", )

total_inflation <- prod(1 + usd_inflation$Inflation) - 1
```


It's important to remark that we  the the conversion rates between currencies do not depend _only_ Inflation. 


## Do programmers earn more in 2023 than in 2018?

After consideration we may wonder how the changes relate to the inflation.

The total cumulative inflation betwen 2018 and 2023 was???? __`r total_inflation`__

We now examine how percentage-wise changes in compensation, compare to the inflation

```{r echo=FALSE}
salary_increase <- (exp_sal23$MedSalary - exp_sal18$MedSalary) / exp_sal18$MedSalary

salary_increase_df <- data.frame(
    Experience = exp_sal23$Experience,
    SalaryIncrease = salary_increase
)
salary_increase_df <- salary_increase_df %>%
    mutate(earnsMore = case_when(
        SalaryIncrease > total_inflation ~ "Yes",
        total_inflation >= SalaryIncrease & SalaryIncrease >= 0 ~ "Intermediate",
        TRUE ~ "Less"
    ))


g <- ggplot(salary_increase_df, aes(x = Experience, y = SalaryIncrease, fill = earnsMore)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
    geom_hline(yintercept = total_inflation, color = "black", linetype = "dashed") +
    annotate("text", x = 8, y = total_inflation + 0.03, label = "Cumulative inflation between 2018 and 2023", color = "black", size = 4) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent, limit = c(-0.5, 0.5), breaks = sort(c(seq(-0.5, 0.5, 0.1), total_inflation))) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = c("Yes" = "#8de800", "Intermediate" = "orange", "Less" = "red")) +
    labs(
        title = "Changes In Salary Vetween 2018 And 2023",
        subtitle = "In comparison to the inflation rate",
        x = "Experience level",
        y = "Change in salary"
    ) +
    guides(fill = FALSE)
g
```

As we can see, even though the nominal salary increased in for developers up to 23 years of experience, the only group that earns more after these 5 years are new developers. 

# Admired languages and salary

Now we will examine, if languages that are especially liked by programmers, bring them more income


```{r, fig.width=10, fig.fullwidth=TRUE,fig.height=10, echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
admired18 <- res2018 %>%
    select(AdmiredLanguage, Salary) %>%
    separate_rows(AdmiredLanguage, sep = ";") %>%
    group_by(AdmiredLanguage) %>%
    summarize(SalaryMed = median(Salary), AdmiredLanguageCount = n())

g <- ggplot(admired18, aes(x = AdmiredLanguageCount, y = SalaryMed, color = AdmiredLanguage, fill = AdmiredLanguage)) +
    geom_jitter(show.legend = FALSE) +
    geom_text(
        aes(label = AdmiredLanguage),
        vjust = case_when(
            admired18$AdmiredLanguage == "Python" ~ 1.5,
            admired18$AdmiredLanguage == "CSS" ~ 1.8,
            admired18$AdmiredLanguage == "Visual Basic 6" ~ 1,
            admired18$AdmiredLanguage == "C++" ~ 1,
            admired18$AdmiredLanguage == "Perl" ~ 1,
            TRUE ~ -0.5
        ),
        hjust = ifelse(admired18$AdmiredLanguage == "JavaScript", 1, -0.2),
        show.legend = FALSE
    ) +
    theme(legend.position = "none") +
    labs(
        title = "Sentiment to Salary of Languages Comparison",
        x = "Number of programmers, which want to work with the language",
        y = "Median Salary"
    )
g
```
As we can see we obtain a triangular shape. Langugages, which developers want to use the most, are in the middle of salaries. 

On the other hand the less desired languages spread accros the salary ax. On the one hand, systems that use egsotic???? and unpleasent languages, will pay moreto attract employees, and on the other hand ...



# Is it better to work in big companies?
We wanted to examine if at different stages of professional life it is more worth it to work in small companies or big corporations.

```{r, echo = FALSE,  warning=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=9, fig.fullwidth=TRUE}
company_levels <- c(
    "Freelancer",
    "2 to 9 employees",
    "Fewer than 10 employees",
    "10 to 19 employees",
    "20 to 99 employees",
    "100 to 499 employees",
    "500 to 999 employees",
    "1,000 to 4,999 employees",
    "5,000 to 9,999 employees",
    "10,000 or more employees"
)

company_salary18 <- res2018 %>%
    select(
        CompanySize, Salary, Experience
    ) %>%
    na.omit() %>%
    mutate(Experience = gsub(" years", "", Experience)) %>%
    mutate(Experience = factor(Experience, levels = experience_levels, ordered = TRUE)) %>%
    mutate(CompanySize = factor(CompanySize, levels = company_levels, ordered = TRUE)) %>%
    group_by(CompanySize, Experience) %>%
    summarize(SalaryMed = median(Salary))

company_salary23 <- res2023 %>%
    select(
        CompanySize, Salary, Experience
    ) %>%
    na.omit() %>%
    filter(CompanySize != "I don’t know") %>%
    mutate(CompanySize = ifelse(CompanySize == "Just me - I am a freelancer, sole proprietor, etc.", "Freelancer", CompanySize)) %>%
    mutate(Experience = discretize_experience(Experience)) %>%
    mutate(Experience = gsub(" years", "", Experience)) %>%
    mutate(Experience = factor(Experience, levels = experience_levels, ordered = TRUE)) %>%
    mutate(CompanySize = factor(CompanySize, levels = company_levels, ordered = TRUE)) %>%
    group_by(CompanySize, Experience) %>%
    summarize(SalaryMed = median(Salary))



g18 <- ggplot(company_salary18, aes(x = CompanySize, y = SalaryMed, fill = CompanySize), format(y, scientific = FALSE)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
    facet_wrap(~Experience) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma, breaks = seq(0, 200000, 25000)) +
    theme(
        axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank()
    )

g23 <- ggplot(company_salary23, aes(x = CompanySize, y = SalaryMed, fill = CompanySize), format(y, scientific = FALSE)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
    facet_wrap(~Experience) +
    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma, breaks = seq(0, 200000, 25000)) +
    theme(
        axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
        axis.title.x = element_blank()
    ) +
    labs(
        title = "Salary Distribution On Company Size",
        subtitle = "Divided By Experience Level",
        y = "Salary Median",
    ) +
    scale_fill_brewer(
        palette = "Paired"
    )

g23
```
Interestingly, it seems that working in big giants is always most profitable. On the other hand, the more experience you have the more plot buldge around 500-999 employees. 

# 

# Best paying countries

Of course salary depends greatly on the country you work with. 

```{r world_map, echo=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.fullwidth=TRUE}
convert_country <- function(country) {
    return(case_when(
        country == "Antigua and Barbuda" ~ "Antigua",
        country == "Brunei Darussalam" ~ "Brunei",
        country == "Côte d'Ivoire" ~ "Ivory Coast",
        country == "Iran, Islamic Republic of..." ~ "Iran",
        country == "Lao People's Democratic Republic" ~ "Laos",
        country == "Libyan Arab Jamahiriya" ~ "Libya",
        country == "Republic of Moldova" ~ "Moldova",
        country == "Russian Federation" ~ "Russia",
        country == "Syrian Arab Republic" ~ "Syria",
        country == "The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia" ~ "North Macedonia",
        country == "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland" ~ "UK",
        country == "United Republic of Tanzania" ~ "Tanzania",
        country == "United States of America" ~ "USA",
        country == "Venezuela, Bolivarian Republic of ..." ~ "Venezuela",
        country == "Viet Nam" ~ "Vietnam",
        TRUE ~ country
    ))
}

map_data23 <- res2023 %>%
    select(Country, Salary) %>%
    mutate(Country = convert_country(Country)) %>%
    na.omit() %>%
    group_by(Country) %>%
    summarize(SalaryMed = median(Salary))

world_data <- map_data("world") %>%
    filter(region != "Antarctica") %>%
    fortify()

p <- ggplot() +
    geom_map(
        data = world_data, map = world_data,
        aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, map_id = region),
        fill = "white", colour = "#7f7f7f", size = 0.5
    ) +
    geom_map(
        data = map_data23, map = world_data,
        aes(fill = SalaryMed, map_id = Country),
        colour = "#7f7f7f", size = 0.5
    ) +
    coord_map("rectangular", lat0 = 0, xlim = c(-180, 180), ylim = c(-60, 90)) +
    scale_fill_continuous(low = "thistle2", high = "darkred", guide = "colorbar") +
    scale_y_continuous(breaks = c()) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = c()) +
    labs(fill = "Median Salary", title = "Salary in different countries", x = "", y = "") +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(panel.border = element_blank())

p
```
As shown above, the countries which stand out are USA, Switzerland and Australia
